# Hello and welcome to my Portfolio-Project.
The main goal here is to say hello to any potential employers, present an option to contact me, showcase my coding skills, hopefully make a lasting impression and get hired and last but not least to have some fun. 

I'll update this whenever my schedule allows.
This is a top-priority leisure time project and will be updated frequently until it's done!

Enjoy and thanks for reading :-)
